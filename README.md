# Prompt Engineering App - 6 Building Blocks
This app helps users analyze, improve, and refine text prompts using an AI assistant. The goal is to provide targeted suggestions to strengthen weaknesses and optimize prompts for better AI responses.

### Features
- Accepts a user-entered text prompt as input
- Analyzes the prompt and separates it into its 6 core components or "building blocks"
- Identifies any missing or weak blocks within the prompt structure
- Provides tailored suggestions to fill in missing blocks
- Allows the user to select improvements to incorporate into a revised prompt
- Generates an edited prompt based on the selected changes
### Usage
- Enter a text prompt
- Click "Analyze" to break it down into building blocks
- The app will identify any missing blocks
- Click "Suggest" to get improvement options
- Select suggestions to add to the prompt
- Click "Revise" to generate an updated prompt
- Improvements can be further refined through multiple iterations
### Roadmap
- About page
- Expand suggestion types beyond simple blocks
- Integrate custom models for specific domains/tasks
- Track prompt history and A/B test performance
- Additional analysis metrics beyond just blocks
- Export revised prompts for use elsewhere
